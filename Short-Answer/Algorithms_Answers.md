#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1)  - as n increases the number of operations remains constant n*n*n


b) 0(n^2) - as n increases the for loop remains linear. The while loop is also linear. The number of operations increases due to the < 


c) O(n) - as n increases the number of recursions increases in reatlation. 

## Exercise II

def eggDrop(f):
    if f < drop_height: 
        return 0

    return eggDrop( f -1 )

This time complexity of this recursive solution if O(n)
as f increases the number of operations increases in respectively
